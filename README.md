Simple, cross-platform SVG animantion demo with Snap.SVG

Notes
--

- Standard, pre-jQuery programming style

- Easing and animated fade from transparency effect that utilises librsvg accelerated rendering in modern web browsers

- Works without DOM isolation with object or embed tags. Animation does not interfere with MVC scripts

- All artwork is completely bitmap free

- The total size is less than two disk sectors, and can be made even smaller if SVG gradient definitions are replaced with CSS at cost of IE9 compatibility
